**TracksIt** is a personal, client-based, expense tracker web app that makes use of native web apis to perform tradition serverside tasks.
Everything is stored on the browser using **localStorage**, **indexedDB** and **cacheStorage**. The **Progressive Web App** was designed with mobile in mind

as to make the offline transition a smooth experience.
