# TracksIt - Personal Client-based Expense Tracker app

For a while now, i've been looking for the perfect, completely free, simple, expense tracker that is not going to just use my data to sell me ads.

TLDR; Did not find one. So I decided to just build one myself.
To be fair I did not put much effort into researching for one.

## Tech Stack

Just plain old HTML and Javascript with some libraries like bootstrap(CSS sucks) and Chart.js

For storage I decided to use browser storage cause I did not want to setup a backend(I am lazy!)

Bye now :0
